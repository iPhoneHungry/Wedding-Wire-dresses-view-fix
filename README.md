Wedding-Wire-dresses-view-fix
=============================

-Demonstrates code to fix scroll issue in wedding wire while viewing dresses page in app with ios below 7.

-The issue is not in ios 7.4, viewing mobile page on OSX or Safari ios 6.1.3 but only UIWebView for ios 6.1.3 and below.

Viewing http://m.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses/results?tags%5B%5D=dress-price-700-and-under in UIWebView was 
used for this example though other pages were creating the issue for app users as well.

The main snippit of code that fixes the issue will be found in the UIWebView subclass MyWebView which is:

//--------- start of code -----------------------------------------

-(void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView   {
 
    if (self.iosVersionNot7 == YES) {
        //ios is below 7.0 so checking to block glitch
   
       if (scrollView.contentOffset.y > 60) {
     
            if (self.previousScrolly > 2.0) {
        
               // below if to check for dramatic y change
               if (scrollView.contentOffset.y < (self.previousScrolly / 2)) {
                   
                // blocks dresses webpage from forcing to top randomly
                  NSLog(@"Scroll Denied");
                  scrollView.contentOffset = CGPointMake(0.0, self.previousScrolly);
               }
            }
         // save current y move to become old y
        self.previousScrolly = scrollView.contentOffset.y;
      }
   }
}

//--------end of code -----------------------------------------

Hopefully this will help a few coders out there managing webapps built into native applications
